## React hooks talk

This is an accompanying repo for the react hooks talk.
To see storybook demos of the code, `cd` to the `client` directory and run `npm run storybook`

---

To launch the app graphql demo:
have docker and docker-compose installed

run `docker-compose up` in the root dir.

after everything is built and started you can now go to

`http://localhost` for the app demo
`http://localhost/api/graphql` for the graphiQL tool

All services run in dev mode, so you should be able to tweak code and see in your browser.
